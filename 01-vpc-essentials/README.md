## AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions** are comprised of multiple **Availability Zones**.
- **Availability Zones** (AZs) are where separate, physical **AWS Data Centers** are located.

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

<div align="center"><img src="assets/vpc-diagram.png" width="500"></div>
<br/>

When creating an AWS account, a **Default VPC** is created for us, including the standard components that are needed make it functional:

1. An **Internet Gateway** attached.
1. A **Main Route Table** with predefined routes to the default subnets.
1. A **Default Network Access Control List** with predefined rules for controlling access of the default subnets.
1. **Subnets** to provision AWS resources in (e.g. **EC2 Instances**, **RDS Instances**,...).

<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/vpc-default.png" width="900"></div>
<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/vpc-dashboard.png" width="650"></div>


## Internet Gateways (IGWs)

- Only **one** IGW can be `attached` to a VPC at a time.
- An IGW cannot be `detached` from a VPC while there are active AWS resources associated with **Public IP** addresses or **Elastic IP** addresses.

### State `attached`

<div align="center"><img src="assets/igw-attached.png" width="900"></div>

### State `detached`

<div align="center"><img src="assets/igw-detached.png" width="900"></div>

<div align="center"><img src="assets/igw-detached-diagram.png" width="500"></div>


## Route Tables (RTs)

- A RT contains a **set of rules**, called **routes**, that are used to **determine where network traffic is directed**. 

<br/>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/rt-main.png" width="850">
  <br/>
  <em>Main Route Table</em>
</div>
<br/>

- Unlike an IGW, you can have multiple active RTs in a VPC.
- You can associate multiple subnets in an RT, but one subnet cannot be associated with multiple RTs.
- Subnets that are not explicitly associated with any RTs will be implicitly associated with the **Main RT**.
- You cannot delete an RT if it has dependencies (associated subnets).

<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/rt-diagram.png" width="800"></div>

### Status `blackhole`

<div align="center"><img src="assets/rt-blackhole-diagram.png" width="600"></div>
<br/>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/rt-blackhole.png" width="900"></div>


## Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

- An NACL is an **optional layer of security** for your VPC that acts as a **firewall** for controlling traffic to flow in and out of the **subnets** with which it is associated.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/nacl-diagram.png" width="650"></div>
<br/>

- Rules are evaluated based on **`Rule #`** (a.k.a. rule number) from lowest to highest.
- The first rule that matches to the traffic gets immediately applied and executed, regardless of any rules that come after (have a higher **`Rule #`**).

<br/>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/nacl-default.png" width="850">
  <br/>
  <em>Default Network ACL</em>
</div>
<br/>

- Any new NACLs you create **DENY** all traffic by default.
- A subnet can only be associated with **one** NACL at a time.
- An NACL allows or denies traffic from entering a subnet. Once inside the subnet, other AWS resources (e.g. **EC2 Instances**) may have an additional layer of security, **Security Groups**.


## Subnets

> A subnet (shorthand for subnetwork) is a subsection of a network.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/subnet-default.png" width="900">
  <br/>
  <em>Default Subnets</em>
</div>
<br/>

1. When you create a VPC, they span all of the Availability Zones in the region.
1. After the creation, **you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone**.
1. Each subnet **must reside entirely** within **one** Availability Zone and **cannot span zones**.

### Public and Private Subnets

<div align="center"><img src="assets/subnet-public-private.png" width="650"></div>

<br/>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/subnet-public.png" width="900">

  <em>Public Subnet</em>
</div>

<br/>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/subnet-private.png" width="900">

  <em>Private Subnet</em>
</div>


## Availability Zones

> AZs are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs.

<br/>

<br/>

### High Availability

An architecture in a way that the system is always available, or has the least amount of downtime as possible.

- I can always access my data in the cloud.
- My website never crashes and is always available to my customers.

### Fault Tolerance

The ability of the system to withstand failures in one (or more) of its components and still remain available.

- One of my web servers failed, but my backup server immediately took over.
- If something in my system fails, it can repair itself.
