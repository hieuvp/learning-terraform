## What is a Golden Image

A golden image provides the template which a virtual machine
(e.g. AWS EC2 instances) is created from.
It may also be referred to as a base image or an image template.

The idea is that you set up an operating system to the desired state,
save it and then you can re-use it across your infrastructure.

You might hear this term in the world of virtual machines (VMs),
where a golden image of a carefully configured virtual drive
is the source from which all new virtual machines are cloned.

### Tips for Getting Started

- Goal is to have as few Golden Images as possible to be used in all Infrastructure Scenarios.

- Include all software and configurations in the Golden Image, OR.
- Install software and do the configuration
  after the golden image has been spun up and is used by a Virtual Machine.

- Do not build images containing secrets like API Keys and Passwords.

## What is Packer

> HashiCorp Packer has become
> the standard open source tool for creating golden images from code.

Learn how to use HashiCorp Packer in an Azure pipeline to maintain immutable infrastructure.
A battle-tested virtual machine template
that forms the foundation for all other VMs used in the infrastructure.
Sometimes they are called base images or image templates,
but the goal remains the same: immutable infrastructure.

You will see how to create pipelines to host golden images in Azure,
and make them available through Azure's Shared Image Gallery.
Simply do the configuration work once, and use it across your entire infrastructure.
It will save you time, make you faster and reduce human error.

Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images
for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.
Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant,
creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel.
Packer does not replace configuration management like Chef or Puppet.
In fact, when building images,
Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the image.

## Concepts

### [Builders](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders)

Builders are responsible for creating machines and generating images from them for various platforms.
For example, there are separate builders for EC2, VMware, VirtualBox, etc.
Packer comes with many builders by default, and can also be extended to add new builders.

### [Provisioners](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners)

Provisioners are components that install and configure software within a running machine
prior to that machine being turned into a static image.
They perform the major work of making the image contain useful software.
Example provisioners include shell scripts, Chef, Puppet, etc.

### [Post-Processors](https://www.packer.io/docs/post-processors)

Post-processors run after the image is
built by the builder and provisioned by the provisioner(s).
They can be used to compress artifacts, upload artifacts, re-package, or more.

### [Templates](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates)

Templates are JSON files which define one or more builds
by configuring the various components of Packer.
Packer is able to read a template and use that information to create multiple machine images in parallel.

#### [Template Post-Processors](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/post-processors)

The post-processor section within a template configures any post-processing
that will be done to images built by the builders.
Examples of post-processing would be compressing files, uploading artifacts, etc.

Post-processors are optional.
If no post-processors are defined within a template,
then no post-processing will be done to the image.
The resulting artifact of a build is just the image outputted by the builder.

#### [Template Communicators](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/communicator)

Communicators are the mechanism Packer uses to
upload files, execute scripts, etc. with the machine being created.

#### [Template Engine](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/engine)

All strings within templates are processed by a common Packer templating engine,
where variables and functions can be used to modify the value of a configuration parameter at runtime.

The syntax of templates uses the following conventions:

- Anything template related happens within double-braces: `{{ }}`.
- Functions are specified directly within the braces, such as `{{timestamp}}`.
- Template variables are prefixed with a period and capitalized, such as `{{.Variable}}`.

#### [Template User Variables](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables)

User variables allow your templates to be further configured
with variables from the command-line, environment variables, Vault, or files.
This lets you parameterize your templates so that
you can keep secret tokens, environment-specific data,
and other types of information out of your templates.
This maximizes the portability of the template.

Using user variables expects you to know how configuration templates work.
If you don't know how configuration templates work yet, please read that page first.

## Practices

### [AMI Builder (EBS backed)](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs)

Type: `amazon-ebs`

The amazon-ebs Packer builder is able to create Amazon AMIs backed by EBS volumes for use in EC2.
For more information on the difference between EBS-backed instances and instance-store backed instances,
see the "storage for the root device" section in the EC2 documentation.

This builder builds an AMI by launching an EC2 instance from a source AMI,
provisioning that running machine, and then creating an AMI from that machine.
This is all done in your own AWS account.
The builder will create temporary keypairs, security group rules, etc.
that provide it temporary access to the instance while the image is being created.
This simplifies configuration quite a bit.

The builder does not manage AMIs.
Once it creates an AMI and stores it in your account,
it is up to you to use, delete, etc. the AMI.

### Common Provisioners

#### [File Provisioner](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/file)

Type: `file`

The file Packer provisioner uploads files to machines built by Packer.
The recommended usage of the file provisioner is to use it to upload files,
and then use shell provisioner to move them to the proper place, set permissions, etc.

Warning: You can only upload files to locations
that the provisioning user (generally not root) has permission to access.
Creating files in /tmp and using a shell provisioner to move them into the final location
is the only way to upload files to root owned locations.

The file provisioner can upload both single files and complete directories.

#### [Shell Provisioner](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/shell)

Type: `shell`

The shell Packer provisioner provisions machines built by Packer using shell scripts.
Shell provisioning is the easiest way to get software installed and configured on a machine.

## Cleanup Amazon EBS-Backed AMI

When you deregister an Amazon EBS-backed AMI,
it doesn't affect the snapshot(s)
that were created for the volume(s) of the instance during the AMI creation process.
You will continue to incur storage costs for the snapshots.
Therefore, if you are finished with the snapshots, you should delete them.

Singapore
t2.micro 1 Variable 1 GiB EBS Only \$0.0146 per Hour

You are only charged for the storage of the bits that make up your AMI,
there are no charges for creating an AMI.
EBS-backed AMIs are made up of snapshots of the EBS volumes that form the AMI.
You will pay storage fees for those snapshots according to the rates listed here.
<https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/>
Your EBS volumes are not "duplicated" until the instance is launched,
at which point a volume is created from the stored snapshots
and you will pay regular EBS volume fees and EBS snapshot billing.
<https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/>
<https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ebs-snapshot-billing/>

S3-backed AMIs have their information stored in S3
and you will pay storage fees for the data being stored in S3 according to the S3 pricing,
<http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>
whether the instance is running or not.

Assuming this is an EBS AMI,
you will be charged for the snapshot(s) containing the data for your image.
The relevant pricing information can be found under "Amazon EBS Snapshots to Amazon S3"
at <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>.
"Subscriptions" (Reservations) are available for instances,
but not for the storage of your AMI.

Note that you will be charged separately for the EBS volumes used by your instances.
EBS is not the same as the instance storage included in the hourly fee.
See "Amazon EBS Standard volumes" right above the snapshot information.

Very close to nothing.

There is no cost to make an AMI itself,
but if you're making it from a running instance
you will pay the fees for running a micro instance
(which is about \$0.02/hr, depending on availability region - see the pricing details)
<http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>
and also fees for using the EBS root for however long you use it.

When storing the AMI,
you only pay for the S3 storage taken from the snapshot.
The root FS must be an EBS volume (for all micro instances),
but this is stored as an EBS snapshot
(which are stored in S3, rather than EBS)
so you pay S3 fees to store it.
Note that EBS charges per allocated GB,
while S3 charges per used GB;
with the way they do things,
a 10G EBS volume that only has 500MB on it will only take up approx.
500MB of S3 storage.

Further to that,
Micro instances are included in Amazon's free tier at the moment,
so all of the above will cost you nothing
(with limits - see the pricing link above).
